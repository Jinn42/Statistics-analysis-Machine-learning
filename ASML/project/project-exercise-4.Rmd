This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
A <- read.table('/Users/jinli/Desktop/学习资料/ASML/data/exercise4.txt', header=TRUE)
A
```

```{r}
#(a) i:how to see if there is an influence of the team on the number
attach(A)
number
summary(A[,c("number","team")])
plot(number~team,data=A,pch=15,cex=0.5,col='green')
model <- aov(number~team)
model
summary(model)
#Answer: According to the p-value(0.805) which is bigger than 0.05,the performance are not significantly different with respect to the team 
```
```{r}
#(a) ii:how to see if there is an influence of the station on the number
attach(A)
number
summary(A[,c("number","Station")])
plot(number~Station,data=A,pch=15,cex=0.5,col='green')
model2 <- aov(number~Station)
model2
summary(model2)
#Answer: According to the p-value(0.000314) which is much less than 0.05, we can say that the difficulties associated to each work stattion are not the same
```





```{r}
#(b)iii,Is the variable team influent, iv,Is the variable work station influent?
Y=A[,3]
#X1=station;X2=team
X1=A[,1]
X2=A[,2]
X1
X2

```
```{r}
modeltest <- lm(Y~X1:X2)
summary(modeltest)
anova(modeltest)
```

```{r}
model3 <- lm(Y~X1+X2)
model3
summary(model3)
anova(model3)
#Answer:(iii) No,the p-values of all team variables are bigger than 0.05.
#(iv) Yes,p-values of station C and station D are less than 0.05
```





Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
